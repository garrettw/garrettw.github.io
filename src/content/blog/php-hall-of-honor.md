  I used ChatGPT and Google Gemini along with my own knowledge to compile a list of the most influential members of the PHP community of all time.

**This document is a work in progress.**

Recently, I set out to compile an authoritative list of people who are or have been influential in PHP circles. I knew who I considered to be influential to me, but I wasn't sure how accurate my own list would be in an objective sense -- so I enlisted the help of Gemini and ChatGPT to put everything in the proper context.

My goal with this list is to inform a theoretical PHP newbie of whose public works they should look to, to guide and enhance their learning journey. The list is roughly ranked in order from most influential to least.

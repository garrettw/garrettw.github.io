I am working on making a big list of the most influential members of the PHP community and their contributions in order to spotlight them in a series of blog posts here. The purpose of this is to provide a resource for people looking to learn more about the community or improve their skills by taking influence from the best sources possible.

I am accepting input from the community in an attempt to amass a list of resources (people, tools, libraries, books, blogs, etc.) to write these blog posts about. I have a decent list of names already, but I know my own perspective is limited so I need input from others to have the most complete list I can.

I would greatly appreciate as many people completing this survey as possible!

I don't have any plans to close this survey at a certain time, so as long as I keep getting responses, I'll keep adding to my list and writing content.
